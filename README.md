Development of autotests using Selenium

Git allows you to save changes to code files locally and store a complete copy of the code on a remote server,
 such as github.com. It is useful to have a repository with your project for yourself: to access the code from
 different computers, show it to other people and work on the code together, and it is also a great addition
 to the resume - it will show your skills in practice.
